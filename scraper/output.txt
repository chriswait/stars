<b> Explanation: </b> 
Is the night sky darkest in the direction <i>opposite</i> the Sun?

No.  In fact, a rarely discernable faint glow known as 
<a href="http://www.as.wvu.edu/~jel/skywatch/skw9810h.html">the gegenschein</a> (German for "counter glow") can be seen 180 
degrees around from the Sun in an extremely dark sky.

The gegenschein is sunlight back-scattered off small interplanetary
<a href="ap010813.html">dust</a> particles.  

These dust particles are millimeter sized splinters from 
<a href="ap980712.html">asteroids</a> and orbit in the 
<a href="ap990529.html">ecliptic plane</a> of the planets. 

<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0812d/">Pictured above</a> from 2008 October is one of the more spectacular pictures of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenschein">the gegenschein</a> yet taken.

Here a deep exposure of an extremely dark sky over 
<a href="http://www.eso.org/paranal/">Paranal Observatory</a> in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile">Chile</a> shows 
the gegenschein so clearly that even a surrounding glow is visible.   

In the foreground are several of the 
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/">European Southern Observatory</a>'s
<a href="ap000707.html">Very Large Telescopes</a>, 
while notable background objects include the 
<a href="ap061126.html">Andromeda galaxy</a> toward the lower left and the 
<a href="ap060109.html">Pleiades</a> star cluster just above the horizon.  

<a href="http://io9.com/5662511/gegenschein-the-glowing-circle-in-the-sky">The gegenschein</a> 
is distinguished from <a href="ap040825.html">zodiacal light</a> near the Sun by the 
high angle of reflection.  

During the day, a phenomenon similar to 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997MNRAS.288.1022J">the gegenschein</a> called <a href="ap020417.html">the glory</a> can 
be seen in reflecting air or clouds opposite the Sun from an airplane.

<b> Explanation: </b>

Get out your
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/Help/

check out this awesome stereo view of another world.

<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/
a17.html">The scene was recorded</a>
by Apollo 17 mission commander
Eugene Cernan on December 11, 1972,
one orbit before descending to land on the Moon.

The stereo anaglyph was assembled from two photographs
(<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/

captured from his vantage point on board the 
<a href="ap060107.html">Lunar Module</a> Challenger as he
and Dr. Harrison Schmitt flew over Apollo 17's
<a href="ap110908.html">landing site</a> in the
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17OTM.html">Taurus-Littrow

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Have you ever seen a 
<a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/pillar.htm">sun pillar</a>? 

When the air is cold and the Sun is rising or 
<a href="ap980526.html">setting</a>, falling ice
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal">crystals</a> 
can reflect sunlight and create an 
<a href="ap021110.html">unusual</a> column of light.  

Ice sometimes forms flat, six-sided
<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/primer/primer.htm">shaped crystals</a> as it falls from high-level
<a href="http://eo.ucar.edu/webweather/cloud3.html">clouds</a>. 

<a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/newtlaws/efar.cfm">Air resistance</a> causes these crystals to lie nearly 
flat much of the time as they flutter to the ground.  

Sunlight reflects off crystals that are 
<a href="ap020902.html">properly aligned</a>, creating the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_pillar">sun-pillar</a> 
effect.  

In the 
<a href="http://blogg.astrofotografen.se/2012/12/solpelare.html">above picture</a>

<a href="ap101119.html">Cosmic clouds of gas and dust</a>
drift across this magnificent
mosaic covering a 12x12 degree field within the
<a href="ap100625.html">high flying</a> constellation Cygnus.

The collaborative skyscape, a combination of broad and narrow
band image data presented in the

bright, hot, supergiant
<a href="http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/deneb.html">star Deneb</a>,
below center near the left edge.

Alpha star of Cygnus, Deneb, is the top of the Northern Cross asterism
and is seen here next to the dark void known as the Northern Coal Sack.

Below Deneb are the recognizable
<a href="ap101218.html">North America and Pelican</a> nebulae
(NGC 7000 and IC 5070).

Another supergiant star, Sadr (Gamma Cygni)

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/wea00/wea00041.htm">Normal cloud bottoms are flat</a>.

This is because moist warm air
that rises and cools will <a href="http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_are_condensation_nuclei.htm">condense</a> into water droplets at a specific temperature, 
which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  

As water
<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/GlobalClouds/">droplets grow</a>, an opaque cloud forms.  

Under some conditions, however, <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cld/cldtyp/home.rxml">cloud</a> pockets can develop that contain large droplets 
of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  

Such <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket">pockets</a> may occur in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence">turbulent</a> air near a

<b> Explanation: </b>

That bright star you've recently
noticed rising just after sunset isn't a star at all.

<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/
profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter&amp;Display=OverviewLong">It's Jupiter</a>,
the solar system's ruling gas giant.

Bright Jupiter is nearing its December 3rd opposition when it will stand
in Taurus,
<a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/O/Opposition">opposite the Sun</a> in planet Earth's sky.

<a href="http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3003811">Clearly
outshining</a> yellowish Aldebaran, alpha star of Taurus, Jupiter
is centered in this skyview from November 14th, also featuring the
<a href="ap111117.html">Pleiades and Hyades</a> star clusters,
familiar celestial sights as the northern hemisphere winter approaches.

Sliding your cursor over the image will label the scene and identify
two other solar system worlds approaching their opposition in December.

Small and faint, asteroid Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres are about
10 degrees from Jupiter, near the left edge of the frame.

Of course, you can imagine

Could this dim spot brighten into one of the 
<a href="http://www.space.com/3366-greatest-comets-time.html">brightest comets</a> ever?

It's possible. 

<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/20120925-comet-ison.html">Alternatively</a>, 
the comet could <a href="ap060504.html">break up</a> 
when it gets closer to the Sun, or brighten much

<a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jds/12s1.ukl">optimistic speculations</a> -- that the newly discovered 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2012_S1">C/2012 S1</a> (ISON) could develop a 
<a href="ap091206.html">spectacular</a> tail or briefly approach the 
brightness of the full Moon toward the end of 2013.

<a href="http://earthsky.org/space/big-sun-diving-comet-ison-might-be-spectacular-in-2013">Comet ISON</a> currently is very faint but is just visible at

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</a> by 
Vitali Nevski (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus">Belarus</a>) 
and Artyom Novichonok (Russia), is currently falling toward the Sun 
from between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.

In early 2013 October it will pass very near Mars and possibly be visible to rovers and orbiting spacecraft.

<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/97561/new-sun-skirting-comet-could-provide-dazzling-display-in-2013/">Comet ISON</a> appears on course to achieve 
<a href="ap090322.html">sungrazer</a> status as it passes within a solar diameter of Sun's surface in late 2013 November.

Whatever survives will then pass nearest the Earth in late 2013 December. 

Astronomers around the world will be tracking this large dirty snowball closely to 
better understand its nature and how it

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Have you ever seen a halo around the Moon?  

This fairly common sight occurs when <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/wwhlpr/cirrus.rxml?hret=/guides/mtr/opt/ice/halo/22.rxml">high thin clouds</a> containing millions of tiny 
<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/primer/primer.htm">ice crystals</a> cover much of the sky.  

Each <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystals">ice crystal</a> acts like a miniature lens.  

Because 
<a href="http://www.everythingweather.com/lightning/ice.shtml">most</a> 
of the crystals have a similar 
elongated hexagonal shape, 
light entering one crystal face and exiting 
through the opposing face refracts 22 degrees, 
which corresponds to the radius of the <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/ice/halo/22.rxml">Moon Halo</a>.  

A similar

<b> Explanation: </b>

Beautiful <a href="ap060606.html">emission nebula NGC 6164</a>
was created by a rare, hot, luminous
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/startype.html">O-type</a>
star, some 40 times as massive as the Sun.

Seen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere
3 to 4 million years old.

In another three to four million years the massive star will end its
life in a <a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/
supernovae.html">supernova explosion</a>.

Spanning around 4 light-years,
<a href="http://www.gemini.edu/node/188">the nebula itself</a>
has a bipolar symmetry.

That makes it similar in appearance to more familiar
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula">planetary
nebulae</a> - the gaseous shrouds
<a href="ap120831.html">surrounding</a> dying sun-like stars.

Also like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have
an extensive, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/
nph-bib_query?bibcode=1985PASP...97..780F&amp;">faint halo</a>,
revealed in this deep telescopic image of the region.

Expanding into the surrounding
<a href="http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html">interstellar
medium</a>,
the material in the
halo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star.

<b> Explanation: </b>
What's happened to our Sun? 

Nothing very unusual -- it just 
<a href="ap101215.html">threw a filament</a>.

At the end of last month, a long standing 
<a href="http://solar.physics.montana.edu/ypop/Program/hfilament.html">solar filament</a> 
suddenly erupted into space producing an energetic Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). 

<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/09/10/a-huge-solar-filament-erupts-into-space/">The filament</a> had been held up for days by the Sun's ever changing 
<a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/magnetism/magneticfields.html">magnetic field</a> 
and the timing of the eruption was unexpected.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/sets/72157631408160534/">Watched closely</a> by the Sun-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, the resulting

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/7938936660/in/set-72157631408160534">shot</a> electrons and ions into the Solar System, some of which arrived at Earth three days later and impacted Earth's 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a>, causing visible 
<a href="ap120321.html">aurorae</a>.

Loops of plasma surrounding an

<b> Explanation: </b>

September's <a href="ap070923.html">equinox</a>
arrives tomorrow as the Sun crosses the celestial equator heading south.

The event marks the astronomical beginning of spring
in the southern hemisphere and autumn in the north.

And though
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/
ast26oct_1/">the connection</a>
is still puzzling, the equinox seasons bring an increase
in geomagnetic storms.

So as northern nights grow longer, the equinox also heralds
the arrival of a good season for
<a href="ap120209.html">aurora hunters</a>.

Recorded on September 20,
<a href="http://nordlysfoto.blogspot.com/2012/09/
breath-taking-auroras.html">these colorful northern lights</a>
were captured with camera and wide-angle lens
near the Norwegian Sea coast outside TromsÃ¸ in Northern Norway.

<a href="http://odin.gi.alaska.edu/FAQ/#altitude">Shining at
altitudes</a> of 100 kilometers or so,
the aurora rays are parallel, but perspective makes them appear to
radiate from a vanishing point behind the silhouetted pine tree.

Stars in this enchanting northern night
<a href="ap110514.html">include Polaris</a>
above and right of the tree top, and
yellowish giant stars
<a href="http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/shedar.html">Shedar</a>

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Sometimes it's hard to believe what you see in the sky.

During the <a href="http://www.expedicionesweb.com/ruta12/diario/">Shelios</a>
<a href="http://gloria-project.eu/2012/08/shelios-en/">Expedition</a> 
to Greenland in late August, even veteran sky enthusiasts saw auroras 
so colorful, so 
<a href="ap101124.html">fast changing</a>, 
and so unusual in form that they could remember nothing like it. 

As the ever changing auroras evolved, 
<a href="image/1210/auroraforms_casado_960.jpg">huge shapes</a> 
spread across the sky morphed from one familiar form into another, 
including what looked to be the head of a 
<a href="http://www.trifectaboergoats.com/images/Upload/600/2009-4-15-no2-Smooth-Criminal.jpg">goat</a> (shown above), 
the head of an elephant, a strange green-tailed comet, 
and fingers on a celestial hand.

Even without the aurora, the sky would be notable for the 
<a href="ap120801.html">arching band</a> of our 
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html">Milky Way Galaxy</a> 
and the interesting field of stars, nebulas, and galaxies.

In contrast, in the foreground is a farm house in

The <a href="http://www.shelios.com/">Shelios project</a> 
exists not only to observe

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Oh what a
<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/100/338.25.html">tangled web</a>
a <a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html">planetary nebula</a> can weave. 

The <a href="ap980106.html">Red Spider Planetary Nebula</a>
shows the complex structure that can result when a
<a href="ap100627.html">normal star</a> ejects
its outer gases and becomes a
<a href="ap000910.html">white dwarf</a> star.

Officially tagged
<a href="http://spider.seds.org/ngc/ngc.html">NGC</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Spider_Nebula">6537</a>, this two-lobed symmetric 
<a href="planetary_nebulae.html">planetary nebula</a>
houses one of the
<a href="ap000730.html">hottest white dwarfs</a> ever observed,
probably as part of a <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/binaries/visual.html">binary star</a> system. 

Internal <a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wsolwind.html">winds</a> emanating from the central stars, visible in the center,
have been measured in excess of 1000 kilometers per second.

These
<a href="ap000318.html">winds</a> expand the
nebula, flow along the nebula's walls, and cause waves of hot
<a href="http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml">gas</a> and
<a href="ap030706.html">dust</a> to collide. 

<a href="http://education.jlab.org/atomtour/">Atoms</a>
caught in these colliding shocks radiate light shown in the
above representative-color picture by the
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. 

The
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26A...362L..17P">Red Spider Nebula</a> lies toward the <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html">constellation</a> of the Archer 
(<a href="http://www.astronomical.org/constellations/sgr.html">Sagittarius</a>).

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="ap050819.html">Every book</a>

And so this lovely blue cosmic cloud begins the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966AJ.....71..990V">van
den Bergh Catalog</a> (vdB) of stars surrounded by reflection nebulae.

<a href="ap091229.html">Interstellar dust clouds</a>
reflecting the light of the nearby stars,
the nebulae usually appear blue because scattering by the dust grains
is more effective at shorter (bluer) wavelengths.

The same type of
<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/
blusky.html">scattering</a> gives planet Earth its
<a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/14.html">blue

Van den Bergh's 1966 list contains a total of 158 entries more
easily visible from the northern hemisphere, including
bright <a href="ap110921.html">Pleiades</a>
cluster stars and other popular targets for astroimagers.

Less than 5 light-years across,
VdB1 lies about 1,600 light-years distant in the constellation
Cassiopeia.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Sometimes both heaven and Earth erupt.

Colorful aurorae erupted unexpectedly earlier this month, with 
<a href="ap110517.html">green aurora</a> appearing near the horizon and brilliant bands of 
<a href="ap120201.html">red aurora</a> blooming high overhead. 

A bright Moon lit the foreground of this picturesque scene, 
while familiar stars could be seen far in the distance. 

With planning, the careful astrophotographer shot this image mosaic in the field of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Dome_Geyser">White Dome Geyser</a> in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> 
in the western USA.

Sure enough, just after midnight, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL-sh5GQNCE">White Dome erupted</a> -- spraying a stream of water and vapor many meters into the air.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyser">Geyser</a> water is heated to steam by 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xExdEXOaA9A">scalding magma</a> several 
kilometers below, and rises through rock 
<a href="ap020602.html">cracks</a> to the surface.

About half of all known geysers occur in 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV-RQHPQu2Y">Yellowstone National Park</a>.

Although the 
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast29dec99_1/">geomagnetic storm</a> 
that created these aurorae has since subsided, eruptions of White Dome Geyser continue about every 30 minutes.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
In front of a famous background of stars and galaxies lies some of Earth's more unusual trees.

Known as quiver trees, they are actually 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant">succulent</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe">aloe</a> plants that can grow to tree-like proportions.

The <a href="http://www.arkive.org/quiver-tree/aloe-dichotoma/">quiver tree</a> 
name is derived from the historical usefulness of their hollowed branches as dart holders.

Occurring primarily in southern 
<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbExt/region_afr.html">Africa</a>, the trees pictured in the 
<a href="http://floriansphotographs.blogspot.com/2012/12/quiver-trees-by-night-1-2-3.html">above 16-exposure composite</a> are in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_Tree_Forest">Quiver Tree Forest</a> 
located in southern Namibia.

Some of the tallest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_tree">quiver trees</a> 
in the park are estimated to be about 300 years old.

Behind 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs2eX1AJPrc">the trees</a>

left the long and colorful trail across
<a href="http://www.nuitsacrees.fr/blog2011-2012/index.html">this
all-sky view</a>.

Its grazing impact with planet Earth's atmosphere began at
71 kilometers per <i>second</i>.

With the Milky Way stretching from horizon to horizon,
the scene was captured on the night of November 17
from the
<a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/astrocdf67/

Champ du Feu in Alsace, France.

Of course, the

as our fair planet annually sweeps

The shower's <a href="ap061118.html">radiant point</a>
in the constellation Leo
is very close to the eastern horizon, near the start of the
trail at the lower left.

Bright planet Jupiter is also easy to spot, immersed in
a faint band of <a href="ap121020.html">Zodiacal</a>
light just below and right of center.

The image is part of a dramatic time-lapse video

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="http://earthsky.org/tonight/
smallest-full-moon-of-year-and-penumbral-eclipse-november-28">Did
you see</a> the big, bright, beautiful Full Moon Wednesday night?

That was actually a Micro Moon!

On that night, the smallest Full Moon of 2012 reached its full phase only
about <a href="http://fourmilab.ch/earthview/pacalc.html">4 hours before
apogee</a>, the most distant point from Earth in the
Moon's elliptical orbit.

Of course, earlier this year on May 6,
a Full Super Moon was near perigee, the closest
<a href="http://fourmilab.ch/earthview/moon_ap_per.html">point
in its orbit</a>.

The relative <a href="ap080801.html">apparent size</a> of November 28's
Micro Moon (right) is compared to the famous
<a href="ap120511.html">May 6 Super Moon</a> in these two panels,
<a href="http://www.astrosnake.com/gallery/moon.htm">matching
telescopic images</a> from Bucharest, Romania.

<a href="http://www.perseus.gr/
Astro-Lunar-Scenes-Apo-Perigee-2010.htm">The difference</a>
in apparent size represents a difference in distance
of just under 50,000 kilometers between apogee and perigee, given
the Moon's average distance of about 385,000 kilometers.

How long do you have to wait to see another Full Micro Moon?

Until January 16, 2014, when the lunar full phase will occur within
about 3 hours of apogee.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Does this strange dark ball look somehow familiar?

If so, that might be because it is our Sun.

In the above image, a 
<a href="http://scopetrader.com/jimlafferty/?page=238">detailed solar view</a> 
was captured originally in a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_alpha">very specific color</a> 
of red light, then rendered in black and white, and then color inverted.

Once complete, the resulting image was added to a starfield, then also color inverted.

Visible in the above image of the Sun are 
<a href="ap120820.html">long light filaments</a>, dark active regions, 
<a href="ap110307.html">prominences peeking</a> around the edge, and a 
<a href="ap081102.html">moving carpet</a> 
of hot gas.

The surface of our Sun has become a particularly busy place over the 
<a href="ap091104.html">past two years</a> because it is now nearing 
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/20jul_tasteofsolarmax/">Solar Maximum</a>, the time when its surface 
<a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/magnetism/magneticfields.html">magnetic field</a> 
is wound up the most.

Besides an active Sun being so picturesque, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29">plasma</a> 
expelled can also become picturesque when it impacts the 
<a href="http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Magnetosphere/overview.html">Earth's magnetosphere</a> and creates 
<a href="ap110517.html">auroras</a>.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why is this nebula so complex?

When a star like our Sun is dying, it will cast off its outer layers, usually into a simple overall shape.

Sometimes this shape is a 
<a href="ap121008.html">sphere</a>, sometimes a 
<a href="ap050612.html">double lobe</a>, and sometimes a 
<a href="ap091115.html">ring</a> or a 
<a href="ap030510.html">helix</a>. 

In the case of planetary nebula 
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2012/49/caption.html">NGC 5189</a>, 
however, no such simple structure has emerged. 

To help find out why, the Earth-orbiting 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> 
recently observed <a href="ap951211.html">NGC 5189</a> in great detail.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1297">Previous findings</a> 
indicated the existence of multiple epochs of material outflow, 
including a recent one that created a bright but distorted 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">torus</a>
running horizontally
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/49/
image/a/">across image center</a>. 

Results appear consistent with a hypothesis that the 
<a href="http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18008">dying star</a> 
is part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecz9GEOE9Wg">binary star</a> system with a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession">precessing</a> symmetry axis.

Given this <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/phase2-public/12812.pdf">new data</a>, though, research is sure to continue.

<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/49/fastfacts/">NGC 5189</a> spans about three light years and lies about 3,000 light years

<b> Explanation: </b> 

Some people are so inspired by solar eclipses that they 
<a href="ap051016.html">quilt</a>. 

Pictured above is a resulting textile from one such inspiration.

The 38x38 inch quilt offers impressions of a total
<a href="ap120519.html">annular eclipse</a>,
when the Moon is too far from the Earth to cover the entire Sun,
<a href="ap051007.html">witnessed</a> in Spain in October of 2005. 

Today, however, a full

For a few minutes, those near the center of the 
<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEanimate/SEanimate2001/SE2012Nov13T.GIF">eclipse path</a> will see the entire 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse">Sun blocked</a>

of the area surrounding Sgr A* at X-ray energies higher than
those accessible to Chandra and XMM observatories.

Spanning two days of NuSTAR observations,
the flare sequence is illustrated in the panels at the far right.

X-rays are generated in material heated to over 100 million
degrees Celsius, accelerated to nearly the speed of light as it
falls into the Miky Way's central black hole.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
What could cause a nebula to appear square?

No one is quite sure.

The hot star system known as
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/316/5822/247.abstract">MWC 922</a>, however, appears to be embedded in a nebula with just such a shape.  

The <a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~gekko/redsquare.html">above image</a> combines
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared">infrared</a> exposures from the
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/hale.html">Hale Telescope</a> on
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/">Mt. Palomar</a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a>, and the
<a href="ap971227.html">Keck-2 Telescope</a> on
<a href="ap050704.html">Mauna Kea</a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaii</a>.  

A leading progenitor hypothesis for the
<a href="ap020618.html">square nebula</a> is that the central star or stars
somehow expelled cones of gas during a late
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W13ZYepDBvo">developmental stage</a>.

For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square_Nebula">MWC 922</a>,
these cones happen to incorporate nearly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle">right angles</a>
and be visible from the sides.  

Supporting evidence for the
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cone.html">cone</a>
hypothesis includes radial spokes in the image that might run along the
<a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/5701896/2/istockphoto_5701896-cone-head-man.jpg">cone</a> walls.

Researchers speculate that the cones viewed from
another angle would appear similar to the gigantic rings of
<a href="ap070107.html">supernova 1987A</a>,
possibly indicating that a star in MWC 922 might one day itself explode in a similar

<b> Explanation: </b>

On the morning of November 14,
<a href="http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html">the Moon's
umbral shadow</a> tracked across northern Australia before heading into
the southern Pacific.

Captured from a hilltop some 30 miles west of the outback town of
Mount Carbine, Queensland, a series of exposures follows
the progress of the
<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEmono/TSE2012/TSE2012.html">total
solar eclipse</a> in this
<a href="http://www.launchphotography.com/
Total_Solar_Eclipse_2012.html">dramatic composite image</a>.

The sequence begins near the horizon.

The Moon steadily encroaches on the reddened face of the Sun,
rising as the eclipse progresses.

<a href="ap090730.html">At the total phase</a>,
lasting about 2 minutes for that location,
an otherwise faint <a href="ap021213.html">solar corona</a>
shimmers around the eclipsed disk. 

Recorded during totality, the background exposure shows a still sunlit
sky near the horizon, just beyond a sky darkened by
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  

About 9,000 years ago that star exploded in a
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html">supernova</a> leaving the
<a href="http://www.skyhound.com/sh/archive/aug1/NGC_6960.html">Veil Nebula</a>, also known as the Cygnus Loop.

At the time, the <a href="ap010928.html">expanding cloud</a>
was likely as bright as a crescent <a href="ap051113.html">Moon</a>, remaining
visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/334517.stm">recorded history</a>.  

Today, the resulting <a href="supernova_remnants.html">supernova remnant</a>
has faded and is
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7l9m2pFXM">now visible</a> only through a small telescope

toward the

(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)">Cygnus</a>).

The remaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil">Veil</a>

<a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html">light-years</a> distant, it covers over five times the size of the

<b> Explanation: </b> 
They might look like trees on Mars, but they're not.

Groups of dark brown streaks have been photographed by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> on melting pinkish sand dunes covered with light frost.

The <a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007962_2635">above image</a> was taken in 2008 April near the
<a href="ap021224.html">North Pole</a> of Mars.

At that time,
<a href="ap060823.html">dark sand</a> on the interior of
Martian sand
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_dune">dunes</a>
became more and more  visible as the

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76CNkxizQuc">carbon dioxide ice</a>.  

When occurring near the top of a dune,
<a href="ap070805.html">dark sand may cascade</a> down the dune leaving
<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/11/another-dose-of-martian-awesome/">dark surface streaks</a> -- streaks that might appear at first to be

Objects about 25 centimeters across are resolved on
<a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007962_2635">this image</a> spanning about one kilometer.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Stars are sometimes born in the midst of chaos. 

About 3 million years ago in the nearby galaxy 
<a href="ap030924.html">M33</a>, a large cloud of gas 
spawned dense internal knots which gravitationally 
collapsed to form stars. 

<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m033_n604.html">NGC 604</a> was so large, however, it could form enough stars to make a 
<a href="globular_clusters.html">globular cluster</a>. 

Many young stars from 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elsz-YtGyPk">this cloud</a> are <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2003/30/image/">visible</a> in the 
<a href="http://www.waid-observatory.com/NGC0604-2012-09-30-HLA.html">above image</a> from the 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, 
along with what is left of the initial 
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2003/30/supplemental.html">gas cloud</a>. 

Some stars were so massive they have already 
evolved and exploded in a 
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html">supernova</a>. 

The <a href="ap021102.html">brightest stars</a> that are left emit light 
so energetic that they create one of the largest clouds of 
<a href="ap030410.html">ionized hydrogen</a> gas known, 
comparable to the 
<a href="ap030823.html">Tarantula Nebula</a> in our

<b> Explanation: </b>

NGC 660 is featured in
<a href="http://www.gemini.edu/node/11896">this cosmic snapshot</a>,
a sharp composite of broad and narrow band filter image data from
the Gemini North telescope
<a href="ap090219.html">on Mauna Kea</a>.

Over 20 million light-years away and swimming within
the boundaries of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Pisces_(constellation)">constellation Pisces</a>,
NGC 660's peculiar appearance marks it as
<a href="ap070216.html">a polar ring galaxy</a>.

A rare galaxy type, polar ring galaxies have a substantial population
of stars, gas, and dust
<a href="ap990510.html">orbiting in rings</a> nearly perpendicular
to the plane of the galactic disk.

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301391">The bizarre-looking
configuration</a> could have been caused by the chance capture
of material from a passing galaxy by a disk galaxy, with the captured
debris eventually strung out in a rotating ring.

The violent gravitational interaction would account
for the myriad pinkish star forming regions scattered along NGC 660's ring.

<a href="http://www.obspm.fr/actual/nouvelle/apr03/prg.en.shtml">The
polar ring component</a> can also be used
to explore the shape of the galaxy's otherwise unseen

Broader than the disk, NGC 660's ring spans over 50,000 light-years.

Near the center of <a href="http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/
TrapMosaic-HST-Gendler.html">this sharp cosmic portrait</a>, at
the heart of <a href="ap090222.html">the Orion Nebula</a>,
are four hot, massive stars
<a href="http://messier.seds.org/more/m042_trapezium.html">known as
the Trapezium</a>.

Gathered within a region about 1.5 light-years in radius,
they dominate the core of the dense Orion Nebula Star Cluster.

Ultraviolet ionizing radiation from the Trapezium stars,
mostly from the brightest star
<a href="http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/theta1ori.html">Theta-1
Orionis C</a>
powers the complex star forming region's entire visible glow.

About three million years old, the Orion Nebula Cluster was
even more compact in its younger years and a
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2114">recent dynamical study</a>
indicates that
<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/skyblog/newsblog/
A-Black-Hole-in-Orion-171183711.html">runaway stellar collisions</a>
at an earlier age may have formed a black hole
with more than 100 times the mass of the Sun.

The presence of a black hole within the cluster
could explain the observed high velocities of the Trapezium stars.

The Orion Nebula's distance of some 1500 light-years
would make it the closest known black hole to planet Earth.

Full Moon lights the night during a time for hunting
in preparation for the <a href="ap120120.html">coming winter</a> months.

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="ap081122.html">A Full Moon rises</a> in this waterfront scene.

Its colorful, watery reflection is joined by harbor lights and
a windowed skyscraper's echo of the western horizon just after sunset.

The tantalizing image is a composite of frames recorded at 2 minute
intervals on November 28 from the Caspian Sea
<a href="ap120920.html">port city of Baku</a>, Azerbaijan. 

Still, this Full Moon was not really as big or as bright as others,
though it might be hard to tell.

In fact, November 28's Full Moon was near apogee, making it the
<a href="ap121129.html">smallest Full Moon</a> of 2012.

As it rose over the Baku boardwalk (along with much of the
eastern hemisphere), it was also in the Earth's lighter or

The subtle effect of the

as the slightly darker left side of the lunar disk.

Encircling the poles and extending to lower latitudes,
impressive aurorae seen

<b> Explanation: </b> 
What's happening around that star?

An unusual spiral structure has been discovered around the Milky Way star 
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1239/">R Sculptoris</a>, a red giant star 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ICtbIDdwZY">located</a> 
about 1,500 light years away toward the constellation of the Sculptor 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptor_%28constellation%29">Sculptoris</a>).

The <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1239a/">star</a> was observed with the new 
<a href="http://www.almaobservatory.org/">Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</a> 
(ALMA), the most powerful telescopic array observing near 
millimeter wavelengths, 
that part of the spectrum situated well beyond red light but before microwaves and radio waves.

Data from <a href="ap111123.html">ALMA</a> observations was used to 
create a 3D 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvJss-EI4KE">visualization</a> 
of the gas and dust immediately surrounding the star.

A digital slice through this data showed the unexpected 
<a href="ap120107.html">spiral structure</a>.

Although unusual, a similar spiral pattern was discovered in visible light recently around 
<a href="ap100914.html">LL Pegasi</a>.

Upon analyzing the data, a 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1210.3030M">hypothesis was drawn</a> 
that the red giant star in R Sculptoris might be puffing gas toward an unseen 
<a href="ap970219.html">binary companion star</a>.

The dynamics of 
<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/tag/r-sculptoris/">this system</a> 
might be particularly insightful because it may be giving clues as to how 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_stars">giant stars</a> 
evolve toward the end of their lives -- and so release some constituent 
elements back to the

Barred <a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/spir.html">spiral galaxy</a>
NGC 1365 is truly a majestic
<a href="ap100109.html">island universe</a> some 200,000

This sharp color image shows intense
star forming regions at the ends of the bar and along the
spiral arms, and details of dust lanes cutting
across the galaxy's bright core.

At the core lies a supermassive black hole.

<b> Explanation: </b>
Yesterday was an equinox, a date when day and night are equal.  

Today, and every day until the next
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox">equinox</a>,
the night will be longer than the day in Earth's northern hemisphere,
and the day will be longer than the night in Earth's southern hemisphere.

An <a href="ap040320.html">equinox</a>
occurs midway between the two
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice">solstice</a>s,
when the days and nights are the least equal.

The picture is a composite of hourly images taken of the Sun above

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</a> on key days from solstice to
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSdDeooDQEY">equinox</a> to solstice.

The bottom Sun band was taken during the
<a href="ap071222.html">winter solstice</a> in 2007 December, when
the Sun could not rise very high in the sky nor stay above the
horizon very long.   

This lack of Sun caused
<a href="ap041130.html">winter</a>.

The top Sun band was taken during the
<a href="ap060621.html">summer solstice</a> in 2008 June, when the
Sun rose highest in the 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky">sky</a> and 
stayed above the horizon for more than 12 hours.  

This abundance of Sun caused
<a href="ap080705.html">summer</a>.

The middle band was taken during the
<a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/the_universe/uts/equinox.html">Vernal Equinox</a> in 2008 March, but it is the same sun band that

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why is this moon shaped like a smooth egg?

The robotic Cassini spacecraft completed the first flyby ever of Saturn's small moon 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/methone/">Methone</a> 
in May and discovered that the moon has no obvious craters.

Craters, usually caused by impacts, have been seen on every 
<a href="ap070225.html">moon</a>, 
<a href="ap100726.html">asteroid, and comet nucleus</a> 
ever imaged in detail -- until now. 

Even the <a href="ap990711.html">Earth</a> and 
<a href="ap041124.html">Titan</a> have 
<a href="ap971110.html">craters</a>.

The smoothness and egg-like shape of the 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/05211206.html">3-kilometer diameter moon</a> might be caused by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methone_%28moon%29">Methone</a>'s 
surface being able to shift -- 
something that might occur were the moon coated by a deep 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzyettXkIqY">pile</a> of sub-visual 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_pile">rubble</a>.

If so, the most similar objects in our Solar System would include Saturn's moons 
<a href="ap060222.html">Telesto</a>, 
<a href="ap051123.html">Pandora</a>, 
<a href="ap100217.html">Calypso</a>, as well as asteroid 
<a href="ap070422.html">Itokawa</a>, 
all of which show sections that are unusually smooth.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14633">Methone</a> 
is not entirely featureless, though, as some surface sections 
<a href="ap120113.html">appear darker</a> than others.

Although flybys of Methone are 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/05211206.html">difficult</a>, interest in the nature and 
history of this unusual moon is sure to continue.

The sketch was made with 800x magnification and

About one light-year across, the nebula is composed
of outer layers expelled from a dying, once sun-like star.

Intense ultraviolet light from the hot central star
ionizes atoms in the gas and powers the nebular glow.

<a href="ap051223.html">Ionized hydrogen</a> adds a reddish tint.

Ionized oxygen produces a characteristic blue-green color.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
What did the first galaxies look like?

To help answer this question, the Hubble Space Telescope has just finished taking the 
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/37/">eXtreme Deep Field</a> (XDF), the deepest image of the universe ever taken in 
<a href="http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/visible.html">visible light</a>.  

Pictured above, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Extreme_Deep_Field">XDF</a> shows a sampling of some of the 
<a href="ap040217.html">oldest galaxies</a> ever seen, 
galaxies that formed just after the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003Sci...300.1904M">dark ages</a>, 13 billion years ago, when the universe was 
only a few percent of its present age.  

The <a href="ap010806.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/">ACS</a> camera and the infrared channel 
of the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3">WFPC3</a> camera took 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odprMkzOst8">the image</a>. 

Combining efforts spread over 10 years, the 
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/xdf.html">XDF</a> is more sensitive, in some colors, 
than the original <a href="ap020901.html">Hubble Deep Field</a> (HDF), the

<a href="ap091209.html">HUDF Infrared</a> completed in 2009.

Astronomers the world over will likely study the 
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/37/image/a/">XDF</a> for years to come to
better understand how stars and galaxies formed in the early universe.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Just before the Sun blacks out, something strange occurs.

As the Moon moves to completely cover the Sun in a 
<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html">total solar
eclipse</a> -- like the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_November_13,_2012">one set</a> to occur over parts of Australia 
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/07nov_totaleclipse/">on Tuesday</a> -- 
beads of <a href="ap060917.html">bright sunlight stream</a> 
around the edge of the Moon.

This effect, known as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads">Baily's beads</a>,
is named after 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Baily">Francis Baily</a> 
who called attention to the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000eaa..bookE5118.">phenomenon</a>
in 1836.  

Although, the number and brightness of 
<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/what2.html">Baily's beads</a> used to be unpredictable, today the Moon 
is so well mapped that general features regarding Baily's beads are expected.

When a single bead dominates, it is called the 
<a href="http://www.alpo-astronomy.org/eclipse/observeeclipses/chapter9.htm">diamond ring effect</a>,
and is typically seen just before totality.  

Pictured above, horizontally compressed, 
a series of images recorded Baily's beads at times

visible from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk">Novosibirsk</a>,

At the end of totality, as the Sun again emerges from behind the moon,

may again be visible -- but now on the other side of the Moon.

<b> Explanation: </b>

On the morning of November 14, sky gazers from around
the world gathered on this little planet to stand in the dark
<a href="http://www.inconstantmoon.com/cyc_ecl1.htm">umbral shadow
of the Moon</a>.

Of course, the Moon cast the shadow during last month's
<a href="ap121116.html">total solar eclipse</a>,
and the little planet is actually a beach
on Green Island off the coast of Queensland, Australia.

The picture itself, the first
<a href="ap120111.html">little planet projection</a>
of a total solar eclipse, is a digitally warped and stitched
wrap-around of 8 images covering 360x180 degrees.

To make it, the intrepid photographer had to remember to shoot
both toward and away(!) from the eclipse during the excitement
<a href="ap121210.html">of totality</a>.

Near this little planet's horizon,
the eclipsed Sun is just above center,
surrounded by the

<b> Explanation: </b> 

What's happening in the sky over 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley">Monument Valley</a>?

A meteor shower.

Over the past weekend the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids">Leonid meteor shower</a> has
been peaking.  

The image -- actually a composite of six exposures of about 30 seconds
each -- was taken in 2001, a year when there was a <i>much</i> more active 
<a href="ap101212.html">Leonids shower</a>.

At that time, Earth was moving through a particularly dense swarm
of sand-sized debris from 
<a href="http://cometography.com/pcomets/055p.html">Comet Tempel-Tuttle</a>, 
so that meteor rates approached one visible streak per second.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid">meteors</a>
appear parallel because they all fall to Earth from the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Radiant_%28meteor_shower%29">meteor shower radiant</a> -- 
a point on the sky towards the constellation of the Lion 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_%28constellation%29">Leo</a>).

Although the predicted peak of
<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/

Leonid meteor shower</a> is over,

<b> Explanation: </b>

Braided, serpentine filaments of glowing gas
suggest this nebula's popular name, The Medusa Nebula.

Also known as Abell 21, this Medusa is an old
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html">planetary nebula</a>
some 1,500 light-years away in the constellation
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)">Gemini</a>.

Like its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa">mythological</a>
namesake, the nebula is associated
with a dramatic transformation.

The <a href="http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html">planetary
nebula</a> phase represents a final stage in
<a href="http://casswww.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/StevI.html">the
evolution</a> of low mass stars
<a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/balick/WFPC2/">like the
sun</a>,
as they transform themselves from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant">red giants</a>
to hot white dwarf
stars and in the process shrug off their outer layers.

Ultraviolet
<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ems1.html">radiation</a>
from the hot star powers the nebular glow.

The Medusa's transforming star is near the center of the overall bright
crescent shape.

In <a href="http://www.imagingdeepsky.com/Nebulae/Medusa/Medusa.htm">this
deep telescopic view</a>, fainter filaments clearly extend
below and to the left of the bright crescent region.

The Medusa Nebula is estimated to be over 4 light-years across.

<b> Explanation: </b>

Like delicate cosmic petals, these clouds of interstellar dust and gas
have blossomed 1,300 light-years away in the fertile
star fields of the <a href="http://www.astropix.com/HTML/E_SUM_N/
CEPHEUSO.HTM">constellation Cepheus</a>.

Sometimes called the Iris Nebula and dutifully cataloged as
NGC 7023 this is not the only nebula in the
sky to evoke the imagery <a href="ap080214.html">of flowers</a>.

Still, this
<a href="http://astrophoto.com/NGC7023.htm">remarkable
image</a> shows off the Iris Nebula's range of
colors and symmetries in impressive detail. 

<a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic0915b/">Within
the Iris</a>, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot,
young star.

The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue,
<a href="http://leo.astronomy.cz/mix/mix.html">characteristic
of dust</a> grains reflecting starlight.

<a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic0915/">Central

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="ap101231.html">An analemma</a> is that figure-8 curve that
you get when you
<a href="http://www.twigsdigs.com/sundials/office/">mark the position
of the Sun</a> at the same time each day
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mfm3yQW16g">throughout
planet Earth's year</a>.

In this case, a composite of 17 individual images taken at 0231 UT
on dates between April 2 and September 16 follows half the analemma curve.

The scene looks east
toward the rising sun and the Caspian sea from the boardwalk in the port
city of Baku, Azerbaijan.

With the sun nearest the horizon, those dates almost span the period
between the 2012 <a href="ap100923.html">equinoxes</a> on
March 20 and September 22.

The northern summer <a href="ap120626.html">Solstice</a>
on June 20  corresponds to the top of the
figure 8 at the left, when the Sun stood at its northernmost
declination.

<a href="ap061230.html">Of course</a>,
this year the exposure made on June 6 contained a little
something extra.
 
Slightly enhanced, the little black spot on the bright solar disk near
the top of the frame is planet Venus, caught in
<a href="ap120620.html">a rare transit</a> during
this well-planned sunrise analemma project.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why does one half of Dione have more craters than the other?

Start with the fact that 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Saturn</a>'s moon Dione 
has one side that always faces Saturn, and one side that always faces away.  

This is similar to 
<a href="ap051113.html">Earth's Moon</a>.

This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidal locking</a> 
means that one side of 
<a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sat_Dione">Dione</a> always leads as the moon progresses in its orbit, 
while the other side always trails.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dione_%28moon%29">Dione</a> 
should therefore have undergone a significant number of impacts on its leading half.

Strangely, the current leading half of 
<a href="ap060905.html">Dione</a> 
is <i>less</i> cratered than the trailing half.  

A leading explanation is that some crater-forming impacts were so large they spun 
<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/2034.pdf">Dione</a>, 
changing the part that suffered the highest impact rate before the 
moon's spin again became locked.  

The <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/10231223-huge-dione-mosaic.html">above detailed image</a> of Dione highlighting the moon's subtle hues 
is a meticulously-constructed mosaic --

<b> Explanation: </b>
This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave">shock wave</a>
plows through space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour.

Moving toward to bottom of this
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1236a/">beautifully
detailed</a> color composite, the thin, braided filaments are actually
long ripples in a sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge on.

<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2003/16/supplemental.html">Cataloged
as NGC 2736</a>, its narrow 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3kPZTXSg2o">appearance</a>
suggests its popular name,
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/
pencil_nebula.html">the Pencil Nebula</a>.

About 5 light-years long and a mere 800 light-years away, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil_Nebula">Pencil Nebula</a>
is only a small part of the
<a href="http://violet.pha.jhu.edu/~wpb/hstvela/hstvela.html">Vela
supernova remnant</a>.

The <a href="ap080306.html">Vela remnant itself</a>
is around 100 light-years in diameter and is the expanding
<a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html">debris
cloud of a star</a> that was seen to
explode about 11,000 years ago.

Initially, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Num9TR7wlrw">shock wave</a> was moving at millions of kilometers
per hour but has
<a href="http://media.egotvonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/93-sleepy-dog.jpg?41ed4f">slowed considerably</a>, sweeping up
surrounding interstellar gas.

<b> Explanation: </b>

In <a href="http://billsnyderastrophotography.com/?page_id=2464">
this stunning vista</a>, based on image data from
the Hubble Legacy Archive,
distant galaxies form a dramatic backdrop
for disrupted spiral
<a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html">galaxy 
Arp</a> 188, the Tadpole Galaxy.

The <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/
2002/11/fastfacts/">cosmic tadpole is</a>
a mere 420 million light-years distant toward the
northern constellation <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/
constellations/constellations/Draco.html">Draco</a>.

Its eye-catching tail is about 280 thousand light-years long and
features massive, bright blue star clusters.

One <a href="http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/">story</a> goes
that a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front
of Arp 188 - from right to left in this view - and was
<a href="http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/">slung
around</a> behind the Tadpole by their gravitational attraction.

During the
<a href="ap120812.html">close encounter</a>, tidal forces drew out the
<a href="ap120604.html">spiral galaxy's</a> stars, gas, and dust
forming the spectacular tail.

The <a href="ap970224.html">intruder</a> galaxy itself, estimated to
lie about 300 thousand light-years behind the Tadpole,
can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper right.

<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/frogs/">Following</a>
its terrestrial <a href="http://www.offwell.free-online.co.uk/

forming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why does this galaxy have so many big black holes?

No one is sure.

What is sure is that
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_U42PDKstQ">NGC 922</a> is a ring galaxy created by the collision of a large and small galaxy about 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic">300 million years ago</a>.

Like a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9QwiBFN9gI">rock thrown into a pond</a>, the 
<a href="ap981219.html">ancient collision</a> sent ripples of
high density gas out from the impact point near the center that partly condensed into stars.

<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/45/">Pictured above</a> is NGC 922 with its beautifully complex ring along the left side, as imaged recently by the 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview">Hubble Space Telescope</a>.

Observations of <a href="http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2012/ngc922/">NGC 922</a> with the 
<a href="http://chandra.si.edu/about/">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>, however, show several glowing <a href="http://chandra.si.edu/photo/2012/ngc922/ngc922_xray.jpg">X-ray knots</a> that are likely large black holes.

The high number of <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/podcasts/ts/ts061212_hd.html">massive black holes</a> was
<a href="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoIIOgmOeBjFjLOtah-cK6OkgRk5PiGfdUSPxvZA_TUXw5DiXL">somewhat surprising</a> as the gas composition in 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atu4XOlXiMM">NGC 922</a> -- rich in heavy elements -- should have discouraged almost anything so massive from forming.  

Research is sure to continue.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_922">NGC 922</a>
spans about 75,000 light years, lies about 150 million light years away, and can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of the furnace (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax">Fornax</a>).

<b> Explanation: </b> 

Is this what will become of our Sun?

Quite possibly.

The bubble of expanding gas
<a href="http://pixinsight.com/gallery/PK164+31.1-CAHA/en.html">pictured above</a> is the planetary nebula PK 164 +31.1, the remnants of the atmosphere of a Sun-like star expelled as its supply of fusion-able core hydrogen became depleted.

Visible near the center of
<a href="http://astrofoto.es/Galeria/2012/PK164/PK164_CAHA_en.html">the nebula</a> is what remains of the core itself -- a blue-hot white dwarf star. 

This particularly photogenic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula">planetary nebula</a> shows intricate shells of gas likely expelled at different times toward the end the star's demise, and whose structure is not fully understood.

This deep image of PK 164 +31.1 from the

<a href="http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=18005">several galaxies</a> far in the distance.

<a href="http://www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/DE/Ins/Per/Kohoutek/kohoutek/WEBcgpn2/text2/index.html">PK</a> 164 +31, also known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones-Emberson_1">Jones-Emberson 1</a>, lies about 1,600 light years away toward the constellation of the Wildcat 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(constellation)">Lynx</a>).

Due to its faintness
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude">magnitude</a> 17) and 
<a href="ap000109.html">low surface brightness</a>, the object is only visible with a good-sized telescope.

Although the <a href="ap011227.html">expanding nebula</a>
will fade away over the next few thousand years, the
<a href="ap100221.html">central white dwarf</a> may well survive for billions of years -- to when our universe may be a

<a href="ap061228.html">angular diameter</a> of the Full Moon,
with <a href="ap091229.html">blue reflection nebulae</a>
scattered around the scene.

And even though this
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galchart.html">line-of-sight
looks</a> away from
the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, it covers a region
known to be filled with nearby molecular clouds.

are less than 1,000 light-years distant.

<b> Explanation: </b>
Next stop: Ceres.

Last week the robotic Dawn spacecraft ended its year-long mission to asteroid 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta">Vesta</a>, becoming the first spacecraft ever to visit this far off world located between Mars and Jupiter, in the Solar System's 
<a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars/asteroid.htm">main asteroid belt</a>.

Many of the best images taken by Dawn at Vesta have been compiled into the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15678">above encompassing view</a>.

Vesta shows evidence of being a leftover from the early years of our Solar System, a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanet">building block</a> for rocky planets like 
<a href="ap070325.html">Earth</a>.

Vesta's ancient surface shows heavy cratering and 
<a href="ap120514.html">long troughs</a> likely created by huge impacts.

The minor planet's low gravity allows for 
<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/103211579003359376826/posts">surface</a> features like 
<a href="ap111128.html">huge cliffs</a> and a large mountain that reaches twice the height of Earth's 
<a href="ap110417.html">Mount Everest</a>, visible at the image bottom.

<a href="ap110802.html">Vesta</a>, however, spanning about 500 kilometers across, is only the <i>second</i> most massive object in the asteroid belt.

And so, two weeks ago, <a href="http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/">Dawn</a> fired its gentle 
<a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sionrock.htm">ion rockets</a> 
and has begun chasing the most massive: 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29">Ceres</a>.

If everything goes as planned, Dawn will reach Ceres in 
<a href="http://images.gizmag.com/hero/mycopter.jpg">2015</a>.

Ceres looks 
<a href="ap070622.html">quite different</a> to the distant telescope -- 
but what will Dawn find?

Of course, the SMC is some 210,000 light-years
distant, a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way and not physically close
to 47 Tuc.

Stars on the outskirts of the SMC are seen at the upper left of

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Why does this galaxy emit such spectacular jets?

No one is sure, but it is likely related to an active supermassive black hole at its center.

The galaxy at the 
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2012/47/caption.html">image center</a>, 
Hercules A, appears to be a relatively normal 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a> in visible light. 

When <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2012/herca/">imaged</a> in

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29">plasma</a> 
jets over one million light years long appear. 

Detailed analyses indicate that the central galaxy, also known as 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...465L...5B">3C 348</a>, 
is actually over 1,000 times more massive than our Milky Way Galaxy, 
and the central black hole is nearly 1,000 times more massive than the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgr_A*">black hole</a> at our 
<a href="ap120702.html">Milky Way's</a> center.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Fresh evidence of an ancient stream has been found on Mars.

The robotic rover 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_rover">Curiosity</a> 
has run across unusual surface features that carry a strong resemblance to stream banks on Earth.

Visible in the 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16156">above image</a>, 
for example, is a small overhanging rock ledge that was quite possibly created by water erosion beneath.

The texture of the ledge appears to be a 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16189">sedimentary conglomerate</a>, 
the dried remains of many smaller rocks stuck together.

Beneath the ledge are numerous small pebbles, possibly made smooth by tumbling in and around the once-flowing 
<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/103211579003359376826/posts">stream</a>.

Pebbles in the streambed likely fell there as the bank 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f62_MjB6-Ok">eroded</a>. 

Circled at the upper right is a larger rock possibly also made smooth by 
<a href="ap101127.html">stream</a> erosion.

Curiosity has now discovered several indications of 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVTyRNbsqk8">dried streambeds on Mars</a> 
on  
<a href="ap120910.html">its way</a> to its

<b> Explanation: </b> 
One of the most identifiable nebulae in the sky,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula">Horsehead Nebula</a> in <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html">Orion</a>, is part of a large, dark,
<a href="ap090623.html">molecular cloud</a>.  

Also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Emerson_Barnard">Barnard</a> 33, the unusual shape was first
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/b33.html">discovered</a> on a
<a href="http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~afs5z/photography.html">photographic plate</a> in the late 1800s.  

The red glow originates from
<a href="http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml">hydrogen</a>
gas predominantly behind the nebula, ionized by the nearby bright star
<a href="http://www.dibonsmith.com/ori_s.htm">Sigma Orionis</a>.  

The darkness of the
<a href="ap061015.html">Horsehead</a> is caused mostly by thick
<a href="ap030706.html">dust</a>,
although the lower part of the
<a href="ap081126.html">Horsehead</a>'s neck casts a shadow to the left.  

Streams of gas leaving
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgTrLozRj40">the nebula</a> are funneled by a strong
<a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whmfield.html">magnetic field</a>.  

Bright spots in the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987AJ.....93.1514Z">Horsehead Nebula</a>'s base are
young stars just in the <a href="ap070218.html">process of forming</a>.  

Light takes about 1,500 years to reach us from the
<a href="ap090224.html">Horsehead Nebula</a>.  

The
<a href="http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0057.html">above image</a> was taken with the

<b> Explanation: </b>
Why are these strange little spheres on Mars?

The robotic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover">rover Opportunity</a> chanced across 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-290">these unusually shaped beads</a> earlier this month while exploring a place named 
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16128">Kirkwood</a> near the rim of Mars' 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_(crater)">Endeavour Crater</a>.

The <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16139">above image</a> taken by Opportunity's 
<a href="http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_instru_mi.html">Microscopic Imager</a> shows that some ground near the rover is filled with these unusual spheres, each spanning only about 3 millimeters. 

At first glance, the sometimes-fractured balls appear similar to the small rocks dubbed
<a href="ap040405.html">blueberries</a> seen by Opportunity eight years ago, but these spheres are densely compacted and have little iron content.

Although it is thought that
<a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-09/plucky-mars-rover-opportunitys-newest-jackpot-should-steal-some-curiositys-limelight">these orbs</a> formed naturally, which natural processes formed them remain unknown.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4e2FyNFIE">Opportunity</a>, an older sibling to the recently deployed
<a href="ap120818.html">Curiosity rover</a>, will continue to study these spheres with the hope that they will provide a new clue to the ancient history of the surface of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">red planet</a>.

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="http://www.potw.org/archive/potw283.html">Double,
double toil and trouble;</a>
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble -- maybe
<a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/macbeth/">Macbeth</a> should have consulted the Witch Head Nebula.

The suggestively shaped
<a href="reflection_nebulae.html">reflection nebula</a>
is associated with the
<a href="http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/rigel.html">bright
star Rigel</a> in the <a href="ap120119.html">constellation Orion</a>.

More formally known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2118">IC 2118</a>,
the Witch Head Nebula spans about 50 light-years and
is composed of interstellar dust grains
reflecting <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/
nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997MNRAS.290..521I">Rigel's</a>
starlight.

<a href="http://blog.deepskycolors.com/archive/2009/11/16/
witch-Head-Nebula-and-Rigel.html">In this cosmic portrait</a>,
the blue color of the Witch Head Nebula and of the dust surrounding
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8CgDGhYKe8">Rigel</a>
is caused not only by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel">Rigel</a>'s intense
blue starlight but because the
<a href="http://leo.astronomy.cz/mix/mix.html">dust grains scatter blue light</a> more efficiently than red.

The same
<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html">physical process</a> causes
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html">Earth's daytime sky to appear blue</a>, although the scatterers in
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html">Earth's atmosphere</a> are molecules of
nitrogen and oxygen.

Rigel, the Witch Head Nebula, 
and gas and dust that surrounds them lie about 800 <a href="http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html">light-years</a> away.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
This moon is doomed.

<a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/extreme/">Mars</a>,
the red planet named for the
<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/m/mars.html">Roman god of war</a>, has two tiny moons,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)">Phobos</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimos_(moon)">Deimos</a>, whose
names are derived from the Greek for Fear and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic">Panic</a>.

These <a href="ap031024.html">martian moons</a> may well be captured
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid">asteroids</a>
originating in the main asteroid belt between Mars and
<a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/jupiter/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>
or perhaps from even more distant reaches of the Solar System.

The larger moon, <a href="ap030329.html">Phobos</a>, is indeed seen
to be a cratered, asteroid-like object in this
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10368">stunning color image</a> from the

seven meters per pixel.

But <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHDH7cKX_SA">Phobos</a> 
orbits so close to Mars - about 5,800 kilometers above the surface compared to 400,000 kilometers
for <a href="ap020504.html">our Moon</a> - that gravitational
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/tidal.html">tidal forces</a>
are dragging it down.

In 100 million years or so <a href="ap080410.html">Phobos</a>
will likely be shattered by stress caused by the

What's happening behind that mountain?

A convergence of variable sky spectacles.  

One night in mid-September near
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TromsÃ¸">TromsÃ¸</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norway</a>, 
high red aurora could be seen shimmering through lower green aurora 
in a way that created a striking and somewhat unusual violet glow.

Suddenly, though, the sky flashed with the
<a href="ap081125.html">brightest fireball</a> the 
astrophotographer had ever seen, as a small pebble from outer space
violently crashed into the
<a href="http://www.ucar.edu/learn/1_1_1.htm">Earth's atmosphere</a>.

<b> Explanation: </b>

Today, the
<a href="http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sseason.htm">Sun crosses</a>
the celestial equator heading south at 14:49 Universal Time.

An equinox (equal night), this astronomical event marks the
first day of autumn in the northern hemisphere and spring in the south.

With the Sun on the celestial equator, Earth
dwellers will experience
<a href="http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/
astronomical-information-center/equinoxes">nearly</a>
12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. 

To celebrate, consider
<a href="http://astrofotos.at/
index.php?view=category&amp;catid=9&amp;option=com_joomgallery&amp;Itemid=134">this
careful record</a> of the Sun's yearly journey

index.php?view=detail&amp;id=406&amp;option=com_joomgallery&amp;Itemid=134">September
29, 2011 through September 9, 2012</a>.

The multiple suns trace an intersecting curve
<a href="http://www.astronomycorner.net/games/analemma.html">known as
an analemma</a>.

In fact, the past year's two equinox dates correspond to the middle
(not the intersection point)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Analemma_Earth.png">of
the curve</a>.

The summer and winter solstices are at the top and bottom.

Of course, many would also consider it a good idea
to travel the mountain road toward the left,
passing the vineyards along the way to reach the nearby town of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzeck_im_Sausal">Kitzeck</a>

<b> Explanation: </b>

A mere seven hundred light years from Earth, in the constellation
<a href="http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/aqr/index.html">Aquarius</a>,
a sun-like star is dying.

Its last few thousand years have produced the
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n7293.html">Helix
Nebula</a> (NGC 7293), a well studied and nearby example of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula">Planetary
Nebula</a>,
typical of this final phase of stellar evolution. 

A total of 58 hours of exposure time have gone in to creating this
deep view of the nebula.

Accumulating narrow band data from emission lines of hydrogen atoms in
red and oxygen atoms in blue-green hues,
it shows remarkable <a href="ap080413.html">details</a> of the
Helix's brighter <a href="ap030510.html">inner region</a>, about 3
light-years across, but also follows fainter
<a href="ap120831.html">outer halo</a>
features that give the nebula a span of well over six light-years.

The white dot at the Helix's center is this Planetary Nebula's hot,
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1997/38/

<b> Explanation: </b>

The small, northern constellation
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/tri/index.html">Triangulum</a>
harbors this magnificent face-on spiral galaxy, M33.

Its popular names include the Pinwheel Galaxy or just
the <a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m033.html">Triangulum
Galaxy</a>.

M33 is over 50,000 light-years in diameter, third largest in the
<a href="http://atlasoftheuniverse.com/localgr.html">Local
Group</a> of galaxies after the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), and our
own Milky Way.

About 3 million light-years from the Milky Way,
M33 is itself thought to be a satellite of the
<a href="ap021021.html">Andromeda Galaxy</a> and
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph?papernum=0506609">astronomers</a>
in these two galaxies would likely have spectacular views of
each other's grand spiral star systems.

As for the view from planet Earth,
<a href="http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M33-Subaru-Gendler.html">this
sharp composite image, a 25 panel mosaic,</a>
nicely shows off M33's blue star clusters
and pinkish <a href="ap091017.html">star forming</a> regions that
trace the galaxy's loosely wound spiral arms.

In fact, the <a href="ap121211.html">cavernous NGC 604</a> is the
brightest star forming region, seen here at about the 1 o'clock position
from the galaxy center.

Like M31, M33's population of well-measured variable stars
have helped make this nearby spiral a

The possibility of ice on Mercury has been entertained for
years, inspired by the discovery of radar bright, hence
highly reflective, regions near the north pole.

Saturn's shadow.

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14934">Imaged
by Cassini</a> on October 17, 2012 during its 174th orbit,
the ringed planet's night side is viewed

the planet.

A 60 frame mosaic, images made with infrared, red, and violet filters

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Sometimes falling ice crystals make the atmosphere into a 
giant lens causing arcs and halos to appear around the Sun or Moon.

This past Saturday night was just such a time near
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid">Madrid</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>,
where a winter sky displayed not only a bright Moon but
as many as four rare lunar halos.
 
The brightest object, near the top of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danicaxete/8237507462/in/photostream">above image</a>, is the Moon.

Light from the Moon
<a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circ1.htm">refracts</a> through tumbling 
hexagonal ice crystals into a
<a href="ap081207.html">22 degree halo</a>
seen surrounding the Moon.

Elongating the 22 degree arc horizontally is a 
<a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circum.htm">circumscribed halo</a> caused by 
<a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/orcol.htm">column ice crystals</a>.

More rare, some moonlight refracts through more distant tumbling ice crystals to form a (third)
rainbow-like arc 46 degrees from the Moon and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danicaxete/8236435325/in/photostream">appearing here</a> 
just above a picturesque winter landscape.

Furthermore, part of a whole 
<a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/46hal.htm">46 degree circular halo</a> 
is also visible, so that an extremely rare -- especially for the Moon -- 
<i> <a href="image/1212/lunararcs_caxete_labelled.jpg">quadruple halo</a> </i> 
was actually imaged.

The snow-capped trees in the foreground line the road

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_de_Guadarrama">Sierra de Guadarrama</a> mountain range near Madrid.

Far in the background is a famous winter skyscape that includes
<a href="http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/sirius.html">Sirius</a>, the
<a href="ap110121.html">belt of Orion</a>, and
<a href="ap100106.html">Betelgeuse</a> all visible between the inner and outer arcs.

Halos and arcs typically last for minutes to hours, 
so if you do see one there should be time to invite family, friends or neighbors to
<a href="ap050913.html">share</a> your unusual lensed vista of the sky.

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic0912a/">NGC 2623 is</a>
really two galaxies that are becoming one.

Seen to be in the final stages of a
<a href="http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/">titanic galaxy
merger</a>, the pair lies some 300 million light-years distant
toward the constellation Cancer.

The violent encounter between two galaxies that may have
been similar <a href="ap120604.html">to the Milky Way</a>
has produced widespread star formation
near a luminous core and along
<a href="ap110429.html">eye-catching tidal tails</a>.

Filled with dust, gas, and young blue star clusters,
the opposing tidal tails extend well over 50,000 light-years
from the merged nucleus.

Likely triggered by the merger, accretion by a
supermassive black hole drives activity within the nuclear region.

The star formation and its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus">active

bright across the spectrum.

This sharp cosmic snapshot of NGC 2623 (aka Arp 243) is
based on Hubble Legacy Archive image data that also reveals

<b> Explanation: </b>

Described as a "dusty curtain" or
"<a href="ap111031.html">ghostly</a> apparition",
mysterious reflection nebula VdB 152 really is very faint.

Far from your neighborhood on this
<a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/oct31.html">Halloween
Night</a>, the cosmic phantom is nearly 1,400 light-years away.

Also catalogued as Ced 201, it lies along the
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4761">northern Milky Way</a>
in the royal constellation
<a href="http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cep/index.html">Cepheus</a>.

Near the edge of a large molecular cloud,
pockets of interstellar dust in the region block light from
background stars or scatter light from the embedded bright star
giving parts of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula">the nebula</a>
a characteristic blue <a href="ap051229.html">color</a>.

Ultraviolet light from the star is also

nph-bib_query?1985ApJ...294..225W&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nosetcookie=1">thought</a>
to cause a dim reddish
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoluminescence">luminescence</a>
in the nebular dust.

Though stars do form in
<a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/
cosmic_reference/molecular_clouds.html">molecular clouds</a>, this star
seems to have only accidentally wandered
into the area, as its measured velocity through
space is very different from the cloud's velocity.

This <a href="http://sleshin.startlogic.com/stargazergallery/

of the region spans about 7 light-years.

<b> Explanation: </b>
How old are Saturn's rings?  

No one is quite sure. 

One possibility is that the rings formed relatively recently in our
Solar System's history, perhaps only about 100 million years ago when
a moon-sized object 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">broke up</a> near Saturn.  

Evidence for a young ring age includes a basic 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133..656V">stability
analysis for rings</a>, 
and the fact that the rings are so bright and
relatively unaffected by numerous small dark 
<a href="ap011118.html">meteor</a> impacts.  

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-149">More recent 
evidence</a>, however, raises the possibility that some of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings">Saturn's rings</a> 
may be billions of years old and so almost as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment">old</a> as Saturn itself.   

Inspection of images by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft
indicates that some of 
<a href="ap040723.html">Saturn's ring</a> particles temporarily
bunch and collide, effectively recycling 
<a href="ap071024.html">ring</a> particles by bringing
fresh bright ices to the surface.  

<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09788">Seen here</a>, 
Saturn's rings were imaged in their true colors by the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">robotic
Cassini</a> in late October.  

Icy bright <a href="ap070909.html">Tethys</a>, 
a moon of Saturn likely brightened by a sandblasting 
<a href="ap071013.html">rain of ice</a> from sister moon 
<a href="ap060310.html">Enceladus</a>, is visible in front of
the darker rings.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
What's happening at the north pole of Saturn?

A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6HpgyTVRYY">vortex</a> 
of strange and complex swirling clouds. 

The center of this vortex was 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassinifeatures/feature20121128/">imaged in unprecedented detail</a> last week by the robotic 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens#Spacecraft_design">Cassini spacecraft</a> orbiting Saturn. 

These clouds lie at the center of the unusual 
<a href="ap120122.html">hexagonal cloud system</a> that surrounds the north pole of Saturn.

The sun rose on Saturn's north pole just a few years ago, 
with Cassini taking only 
<a href="ap070403.html">infrared images</a> of the shadowed region previously. 

The <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/rawimagedetails/index.cfm?imageID=273997">above image</a> is raw and 
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/index.cfm?start=6&amp;storedQ=2508993">unprocessed</a>

<b> Explanation: </b>
<a href="ap121115.html">A dark Sun</a>
hung over Queensland, Australia on Wednesday morning
during a much anticipated
<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEmono/TSE2012/

Storm clouds threatened to spoil the
view along the northern coast, but minutes before
totality the clouds parted.

Streaming past the Moon's edge, the last direct rays
of sunlight produced a gorgeous
<a href="ap060330.html">diamond ring effect</a> in this scene
from Ellis Beach between Cairns and Port Douglas.

Winking out in a moment, the
diamond didn't last forever though.

The area was <a href="http://asterisk.apod.com/

Its well-composed field of view covers
about 2 Full Moons on the

Of course the brighter stars show diffraction spikes, the commonly
seen effect of internal
<a href="http://www.telescope-optics.net/spider.htm">supports
in reflecting telescopes</a>, and lie
well within our own Milky Way galaxy.

The faint but pervasive clouds of interstellar dust
ride above the galactic plane and dimly reflect the
<a href="http://www.galaxyimages.com/UNP_IFNebula.html">Milky Way's
combined starlight</a>.

Known as high latitude cirrus or integrated flux nebulae they are
associated with molecular clouds.

In this case, the diffuse cloud cataloged as
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...346..232W">MBM 54</a>,
less than a thousand light-years distant, fills the scene.

Other galaxies far beyond the Milky Way are visible through the

<b> Explanation: </b>

As the total phase of
<a href="http://www.eclipsecairns.com/">last week's solar eclipse</a>

created the fleeting appearance of a glistening

And while most

a view through thin clouds north of Cairns in Queensland, Australia
also revealed these remarkable flickering 
<a href="http://www.alpo-astronomy.org/eclipse/observeeclipses/

Projected onto the cloud layer, the bands are parallel
to the sliver of emerging sunlight.

Caused by <a href="ap000725.html">turbulence in</a>

the narrow bands were captured

This remarkably complete
<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/
view.php?id=79765">view of Earth at night</a> is a composite
of cloud-free, nighttime images.

The images were collected during April and October 2012
by the Suomi-NPP satellite from polar orbit about 824 kilometers
(512 miles) above the surface using
its Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(<a href="http://npp.gsfc.nasa.gov/viirs.html">VIIRS</a>).

VIIRS offers greatly improved resolution and sensitivity compared to
<a href="ap081005.html">past global nightlight</a> detecting instrumentation
on DMSP satellites.

It also has advantages
<a href="ap120829.html">compared to cameras</a> on the International
Space Station.

While the space station passes over the same point on Earth
every two or three days, Suomi-NPP passes
over the same point twice a day at about 1:30am and 1:30pm
local time.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
How massive can a normal star be?  

Estimates made from distance, brightness and standard 

<a href="http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys230/lectures/star_age/star_age.html">solar models</a> had given one star in the 
<a href="open_clusters.html">open cluster</a> Pismis 24 
over 200 times the mass of our Sun, nearly making it the record holder.  

This star is the brightest object located just above the gas front in the 
<a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0619.html">above image</a>.  

Close inspection of images taken with the 
<a href="ap010806.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, 
however, have shown that Pismis 24-1 derives its 
brilliant luminosity 
<a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0619b.html">not from a single star</a> but from 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...660.1480M">three at least</a>.  

Component stars would still remain near 100 solar masses,

<b> Explanation: </b>

This month's New Moon brought a
<a href="http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html">total
solar eclipse</a> to parts of planet Earth
<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/
OH2012.html#SE2012Nov13T">on November 13 (UT)</a>.

Most of the total eclipse track fell across the southern Pacific,
but the Moon's dark umbral shadow began its

<b> Explanation: </b> 
In 1984, high above the Earth's surface, an astronaut captured a satellite.

It was the second satellite captured that mission.

more than four years, the planet has approximately the same mass as Earth.

But it orbits once every 3.2 days, about 0.04 times the Earth-Sun distance
from its parent star.

That puts it well outside

Still, estimates indicate that planetary orbits would be stable
within the habitable zone of Alpha Cen B, at about half the Earth-Sun
distance ...

<b> Explanation: </b>

Welcome to the December
<a href="ap120121.html">solstice</a>, a day
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html">the
world does not end ...</a> even
according to the Mayan Calendar.

To celebrate, <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/sguisard/Pagim/Chichen-Itza.html">consider
this dramatic picture</a>
of Orion rising
<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/ancientobs/chichen/

ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡, one of the great Mayan centers on the
YucatÃ¡n peninsula.

Also known as the Temple of Kukulkan it stands 30 meters tall
and 55 meters wide at the base.

Built up as a series of square terraces by the pre-Columbian
civilization between the 9th and 12th century,
the structure can be used as a calendar and is noted for
<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/ancientobs/chichen/HTML/

In fact, the Mayans were accomplished astronomers and mathematicians,
accurately using the cyclic motions of the stars,
Sun, Moon, and planets to measure time and

<b> Explanation: </b>

Giant elliptical galaxy M60 and spiral galaxy NGC 4647 do look like
an odd couple in
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2012/38/
index.html">this sharp cosmic portrait</a>
from the Hubble Space Telescope.

But they are found in a region of space where galaxies tend to gather,
on the eastern side of the nearby
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/vir.html">Virgo Galaxy
Cluster</a>.

About 54 million light-years distant, bright M60's
<a href="ap100520.html">simpler egg-like shape</a> is created by its
randomly swarming older stars,
while NGC 4647's young blue stars, gas and dust are organized into
winding arms rotating in a flattened disk.

Spiral NGC 4647 is
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/38/
fastfacts/">estimated to be more distant</a>
than M60, some 63 million light-years away.

Also known
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609786">as Arp 116</a>,
the pair of galaxies may be on the
verge of a significant gravitational
<a href="ap120604.html">encounter</a>, though.

M60 (aka NGC 4649) is about 120,000 light-years across.

The smaller NGC 4647 spans around 90,000 light-years, about the size

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Are those UFOs near that mountain?  

No -- they are multilayered 
<a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/lenticular.html">lenticular
clouds</a>.

Moist air forced to flow upward
<a href="ap080416.html">around mountain tops</a>  can create

Water droplets condense from moist air cooled below the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point">dew point</a>, and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouds">clouds</a> 
are opaque groups of water droplets.

Waves in the air that would normally be seen
horizontally can then be seen vertically, by the

<b> Explanation: </b>
Galaxies don't normally look like this.  

<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2000/34/caption.html">NGC 6745</a> actually shows the results of 
two galaxies that have been
<a href="ap990722.html">colliding</a> for only 
hundreds of millions of years.  

Just off the 
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2000/2000/34/image/a/">above digitally sharpened photograph</a> to the lower right is the smaller galaxy, 
moving away.  

The larger galaxy, 
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/2000/34/supplemental.html">pictured above</a>, used to be a 
<a href="spiral_galaxies.html">spiral galaxy</a> 
but now is damaged and appears 
<a href="ap980315.html">peculiar</a>. 

Gravity has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXy3B2K47Qg">distorted</a> the shapes of the galaxies.  

Although it is likely that no stars in the two 
<a href="ap061024.html">galaxies directly collided</a>, the gas, 
<a href="ap030706.html">dust</a>, and ambient 
<a href="http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Imagnet.html">magnetic fields</a> do interact directly.

In fact, a <a href="http://birrell.org/andrew/knotwork/">knot</a> of gas pulled off the larger galaxy 
on the lower right has now begun to form stars.  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6745">NGC 6745</a>

<b> Explanation: </b> 

Ghostly in appearance,
<a href="http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0636.html">Abell 39</a>
is a remarkably simple, spherical nebula about
five light-years across.

Well within our own

<a href="http://math.rice.edu/~pcmi/sphere/">sphere</a>
is roughly 7,000 light-years distant toward the constellation
Hercules.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_39">Abell 39</a> 
is a <a href="ap030614.html">planetary nebula</a>, formed as a
once sun-like star's outer atmosphere was expelled
over a period of thousands of years.

Still visible, the nebula's central star
is evolving into a hot 
<a href="ap100221.html">white dwarf</a>.

Although faint, the nebula's simple
